## Project Description
I did this project to meet requirements for project 1 at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Winter 2014 class.

It was intended to test our ability to create a fully functional Rails app, respecting the MVC architecture. It required at least 3 models that related to one another as well as one API source. 

I have 6 models and 2 API sources (omniauth-facebook and google). I also used rspec_rails to test my model validations. I also took advantage of partials and helper modules, as well as Model class methods, etc to keep my code DRY.

I would refactor this code some more if given more time.
